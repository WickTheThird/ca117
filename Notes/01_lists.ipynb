It is also a\n","  *sequence type* meaning each object in the collection occupies a specific\n","  numbered location within it i.e. elements are *ordered*. The list is an\n","  *iterable type* meaning we can use a loop to inspect each of its elements\n","  in turn.  \n","- So far a list seems similar to a string. However a list differs in\n","  two significant ways:  \n","  1. A list can contain objects of *differing* and *arbitrary* type. (A\n","    string is made up entirely of objects of the same type, namely,\n","    characters.)  \n","  1. A list is a *mutable* type. This means it can be modified after\n","    initialisation. (A string is an *immutable* type. It cannot be\n","    modified after creation.)
