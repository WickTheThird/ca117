I don't want to repeat myself because to repeat oneself,that is to be guilty of repetition, makes one pedantic
and boring. Let me repeat this point, because it bears
repeating, even if to repeat it is to be repetitious
and repetitive. To finish, if I repeat something twice
how many times do I say it? Repeat after me:
I love programming.
